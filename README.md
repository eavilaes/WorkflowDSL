# Workflow DSL
This is a project developed in the 'Design and Modeling of Software Systems'. In this project we had to develop a DSL using the Eclipse-based MDE tools reviewed in the subject.
The statement of the project can be found in a PDF file, called DMSS1819Project.pdf, which contains all the requirements and specifications for the project.
